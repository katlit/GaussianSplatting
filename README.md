## Project Overview

This repository contains experiments and visualizations for a 3D reconstruction
project based on Gaussian Splatting. In addition to quantitative evaluation,
we provide animated qualitative comparisons to better illustrate differences
in Gaussian density, training convergence, and view coverage.
